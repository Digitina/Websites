            <h3>Requirements Gathering</h3>
            <p>Digitina assists you in gathering and documenting the information that you and your project's stakeholders have in mind. This information can later be used to get a clear overview of the business case you want to build and maybe gather some new ideas along the way.</p>

            <h3>Planning</h3>
            <p>When all the business requirements are known, Digitina will work out and present a planning that can be verified by the project's stakeholders. While building this planning, Digitina will also gather information from the technology experts as to reflect the reality of how long it takes to develop the project as close as possible.</p>
